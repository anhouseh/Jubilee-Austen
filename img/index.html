When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility. mediife or career. ed employees a limited time opportunity to enroll in free online courses. I decided to explore web development. I took my first HTML class and loved seeing my first code for “Hello World”, I loved being able to create something out of nothing and seeing something tangible made me feel so alive. I never had a clear direction on what I wanted to do in life but for the first time, web development made me feel capable, proud, and accomplished.
